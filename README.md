# student-database
A simple google sheets database access script. This README includes instructions on how to copy a simple Google Sheets UI for student database access as well as where to paste the code that allows searching/modifying the database from the UI.

To Use:
1 - Make a copy of the UI created in google sheets here -> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ujfHrzamwVwahlufm-h-W_h9NE-Y3upjemnVn_8WWvE/edit?usp=sharing. There will be three sheets, the first of which is the UI. The second sheet is the settings and the third is the database.
2 - Copy the code in the Code.gs file. Go to the google  and paste it under Extensions->Apps Script in the Code.gs file. The functions in this file must keep their names because they are synced up with the buttons in the UI.
